Disable Touchscreen 
================

The struggle is real!
------------
So my laptop (Lenovo yoga 3 pro) had a little incident and my screen broke hence touchscreen isn't working anymore exept for that small part that kept working on itself and it was so ANNOYING!!.
Of course on windows you can just disable the touchscreen drive, problem solved.
BUT, when it came to linux of course it needed a some heavy googling.
So I am putting This script for you people out there with cracked touchscreens, GOD bless you all!
